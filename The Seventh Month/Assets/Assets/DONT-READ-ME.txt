Im so scared, I should have seen the signs. The footsteps behind me when I was walking home last week. The flowers at my doorstep that I thought were from my boyfriend. The buzzing sound in my room. 

I trusted him. I TRUSTED HIM. I THOUGHT HE WAS MY FRIEND. HE WAS NOT MY FRIEND. and now I am lost. it is dark. i cant see. its wet. i smell the earth. i hear a shovel. i cant move.
