Dear Diary,

Omg. Brandon got me flowers! They're so pretty! He got me red roses, red orchids, orange... I think they are lilies? and these cute pink flowers.. huh idk what they are. They look heart shaped, with a little white flower beneath. 7 flowers each, my lucky number <3 

Okay, it may not be the BEST looking, but its the thought that counts! It's not our anniversary or anything, so romantic! Going to send him a cute text to thank him, he's the best <3
