ok. something does not feel too right. 

Anyways, the 7th month is starting next month. I'll have to be careful not to step on any offerings. Ah Gong said that hungry ghosts will follow you home if you disturb them. No way am I risking that!


Ah Gong and Ah Ma have also been buying joss sticks and joss paper to prepare for burning. They've been telling me a lot of things I should watch out for. I know them already! They say it every year. 

" 要小心啊, 小心一点 。踩到金紙要说对不起 。"


Yessss, I know! And yeah, better to be safe than sorry.
