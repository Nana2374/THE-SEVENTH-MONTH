Dear Diary,

My besties came over today! I haven't been able to spend much time with them bc of more time with Brandon, so yay! We chilled in my room and caught up on uni stuff. 


Rammie's little sister seems to be doing well in CHIG so far. She's really proud of her, I kind of wish I had a little sister as well. She also got a few more piercings! I could never get more piercings, they're so painful. It looks good on her though, really goes with her style. 


J is coping with his art course, he making some game during his free time? I hope he gets it done soon, then Rammie and I can try it out! We got some lunch nearby and bumped into XXXXX. I'm not telling you who <3 I know I have a boyfriend, but he's kinda cuteee

Catch up next time diary!
