Dear Diary,

I got a part time job! The pay is not bad, but I have to go home late. Things are really creepy at night, but the streetlights help. Things have been a little strained with Brandon. 

I can't spend a lot of time with him bc of work, but I'll make it up to him after the holidays end. Maybe a nice lunch together?
