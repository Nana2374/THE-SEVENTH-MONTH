Dear Diary,

Brandon said the flowers weren't sent by him. I checked with my neighbour if she was supposed to receive flowers, but she said no? So who are these flowers for? There wasn't a card or anything, so maybe it wasn't even mine... 

Oh well, I guess I'll still keep them. Better than throwing them out? Flowers these days are expensive you know! Like omg, a bouquet for $60?? I'm pretty much having free money!
